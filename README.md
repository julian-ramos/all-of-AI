## Contextual Bandits
All of the links bellow were found through google searching for contextual bandits notebook

[Nice introduction to Thompson Sampling and linear contextual bandits](https://gdmarmerola.github.io/ts-for-contextual-bandits/)
This website also has a lot of other modern topics

[Mastering reinforcement learning with python](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-reinforcement-learning/9781838644147/B14160_03_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml)
Oreilly book it has python notebooks

# Interpretability

[A Survey on Neural Network Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.14261.pdf)
Review article with a useful taxonomy of the field

[Understanding Black-box Predictions via Influence Functions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04730.pdf)
This paper is mentioned in the above review. The method described finds training observations that had the most influence in a given prediction

[Representer Point Selection forExplaining Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.09720.pdf)
Also from the review. Very similar to the paper above, it also produces observations that had the most influence on a given prediction but the training data points discovered are labeled as excitatory (contribute positively) or inhibitory giving more insight into the value of the training data point.
